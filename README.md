As I begin to work through the Bootcamp, I am showcasing my skills that I've learned thus far and trying to put them into use to make different things happen on screen for the user. 

While I am no pro, I am try my best to do this and I now understand the importance of using time outside of class to study constantly and work on code. 

There are some things here that I didn't work the kinks out of, but I gave it a shot!
